# Encryption Basic Repo

This project includes simple implementations of Caesar and Vigenère ciphers. It also features brute-force methods to guess the password and Kasiski examination to analyze the cipher.

## Features
- Caesar cipher encryption and decryption
- Vigenère cipher encryption and decryption
- Brute-force attack to guess cipher keys
- Kasiski examination and IOC for analyzing Vigenère cipher

## Usage
Run the scripts to encrypt, decrypt, or perform attacks.
